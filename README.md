# Supply-Chain-Lead-Time-Bottleneck-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes supply chain delivery data to understand lead-time behavior,
identify logistics bottlenecks, and evaluate late delivery risks using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Problem Statement
Late deliveries impact customer satisfaction and increase logistics costs.
The objective of this project is to analyze delivery timelines and identify
shipping modes and regions that contribute most to delivery delays.

## Dataset Description
- Source: DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset
- Records: ~180,000 orders
- Domain: Retail / E-commerce logistics

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Key Findings
- Standard shipping shows higher delivery delays
- Certain regions experience consistent late deliveries
- Late delivery risk aligns with actual delivery delays

## Business Recommendations
- Optimize standard shipping logistics
- Monitor high-delay regions closely
- Improve delivery time estimation

## Conclusion
This project used exploratory data analysis to identify supply chain
lead-time inefficiencies and logistics bottlenecks. The insights can help
improve delivery reliability and customer satisfaction.
